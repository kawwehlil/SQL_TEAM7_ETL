### Objectives and Background 
Our team perform as a third-party consulting company called “A+S”, who provides analytical-based services to movie studios. Our current imagined clients are mainly movie producers, including Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures, and Walt Disney. We intend to construct a solid model on capturing the ongoing leading trend of customer movie taste and providing a dependable suggestion for movie producers. We expect that our analytics can actionable insights on creating blockbusters by guiding our clients on movie type, director recruitment, actor selection, and other involved factors. 

### Reasoning process
We read an article “ How Exactly Do Movies Make Money?” BY DINA ZIPIN, updated in Mar 27, 2019. In the revenue breakdown of movie studios, movies only weighs a small amount of the overall revenue structure. One large reason is that audience’s taste is fickle and seemingly unpredictable. Sometimes even though a movie studio throws out a large portion of budget on a big name actor or actress, which is often seen as an extreme investment, can hardly ensure the profitability and success of that movie. 

However, we think that the public’s seemingly unpredictable taste is not that unpredictable. Through analytics, we are confident that we will find the hidden elements that contribute to a success of a movie and find out the patterns of the blockbuster trends. Our project will benefit the movie studios on various aspects, including helping the movie studios to leverage the budget, helping decide the date to release the movie, helping the movie studios to better negotiate with the theaters on contracts. 

### Motivation
We are a group of movie junks who watch movies quite often, and we feel sad whenever we hear the news that a movie we love does not make money and will not have a sequel. Also, it is natural for a consulting firm like us to come up with the idea of digging in what factors affect the profitability of movies. We aim to help Hollywood lower the risks of investing in movies and produce more blockbusters.

### Benefits
Benefits on decision making for our clients
Determine the date to release the movie 
1. The date to release a movie in fact has an effect on the movie’s revenue more  significantly than we think it could be. To predict the time that result in a higher sell of the ticket will help the movie studios make more revenue.
Help negotiate with theaters on contracts 
2. Since it could be time- and effort-consuming for movie studios to negotiate the revenue share contract with theaters, we would facilitate this process with our analytical report that reduces the risk of movie investment. With stronger data backup, movie studios could guarantee the profitability of a movie to theaters, hence requesting a larger share of revenue.
### Other Benefits
1.Find the “hidden reasons” of the success of blockbusters

Movie studios are curious to know what result in a success of a movie and to catch the taste change of target audience. Our goal is to breakdown the elements that result in blockbusters from the data we obtained from TMDB and GroupLen in 2017, find out the hidden patterns and underlying logic of customer behavior, and provide our findings to the movie studios. The movie studios will then be able to leverage our findings and change the plan for the upcoming movies they will produce to be able to catch more audience and enhance the chance of producing the next blockbuster. 
Build a recommender system to produce the next blockbuster theme

2.Time is money, and it is essential to build industry insights ahead of competitors. Beyond upcoming movies, our project provides a stronger system that predicts the features of future blockbusters. What theme could it be? Which genre should it be in? The system could give movie studios the advanced competitive advantage that no other could provide.
Maximize the profit by leveraging the budge

3.For example, we can use our analytical tools to predict the projected revenue for film A, so that we will adjust the budget using for producing that film to maximize the profit. For individual films, under our analytics, movie studios will have a better idea on the money they need to spend on which part to further lower the cost of the overall individual film produced. Our analytics will also help the studios to leverage the overall budget they spent on the films they intend to produce in a year to maximize the profit.
